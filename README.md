# bib_files

Upload your bib files here for folks to share. Every now and then I can create a master bib file, removing all the duplicates. If you use git, use the master bib file and as you add new source push. 

In the readme file, give a brief description of the types of citations you have, that way if someone is looking for a specific literature they can come to the bib_files. See my example (KFruge_bib), below. 


# Descriptions 

* Master_bib.bib : A combination of all bib_files in this section, without the duplicates. (Last updated:Never) 
* KFruge_bib.bib : Mostly human rights, mobilized dissent, repression stuff, with a sprinkle of stuff for coursework.
